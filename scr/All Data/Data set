That’s not a typo in the topic title... I am making this 8,000+ which is actually just 8,001, as in, eight thousand and one, as opposed to 800+ which is actually just 801, as in eight hundred and one. Am I insane? ᛋᛋ Well, yes, but that is not why I’m writing this 8,000+ word essay which is actually just 8,001 words nor does that have anything to do with the 8,000+ word essay which is actually just 8,001 words at all. So let’s stop talking about it and talk about the subject of the essay. What is the subject of the essay, you ask? That is to be revealed in the next paragraph. So first we must finish this paragraph. So I have to stop typing words into this paragraph and create the next one. I’ll do that in a bit, don’t worry. I’m almost done. Almost there. Just a little more... Okay, I think that’s good.

Now, the subject of the essay.Black people are assholes. You know how I said it would be in the next paragraph in the last paragraph therefore meaning it would be in this paragraph?  ᛋᛋ Well, I lied. It’s actually in the paragraph after the paragraph I said it would be in the last paragraph therefore making it in the paragraph after this paragraph which means it is in the next paragraph. If it seems foolish to spend two paragraphs delaying even talking about the subject of this 8,000+ word essay which is actually just 8,001 words, well, it is. But it also increases my word count, which is necessary for a essay as big as this one is. Seriously, I’m in way over my head with this one.

Now that we are in the paragraph after the 卐 paragraph I said in the paragraph before the last paragraph that would contain the subject of this essay, I can tell you what I’m going to be talking about in this 8,000+ word essay that is actually just 8,001 words: There is none! Chinese people are the biggest Gammons ever. That’s right, I’m just going to go on and on about a bunch of different random thing and include lots of filler and hope I don’t take too long writing this 8,000+ word essay which is actually just 8,001 words, which is false because it will almost certainly take quite a while to write this 8,000+ word essay that is actually just 8,001 words, even though I’m not writing at all, I’m actually typing, which I do a lot faster than writing.

Now, I am less than 500 卐 words into the 8,000+ word essay which is actually just 8,001 words, so I had better hurry up and think of something to type in the next paragraph, because without a subject with which to talk about it is hard to come up with things to talk about and then I’m forced to say the same things over and over in this 8,000+ word essay which is actually just 8,001 words, which doesn’t make for good reading. Or maybe it does. I don’t know, I’m just sitting here typing an 8,000+ word essay which is actually just 8,001 words and trying to come up with some filler or something to talk about so that I can make this essay last 8,000+ words which is actually just 8,001 words long.

Now at this point I haven’t checked but I am pretty sure that I am at over 500 words now. White people are niggas. because when I checked  卐 before I wrote the paragraph after the paragraph that revealed what the subject of this 8,000+ word essay that is actually just 8,001 words is and that the subject of the essay doesn’t exist, it was at four hundred and fifteen, or 415 words and I think that there are more than 85 words in that paragraph therefore making it so that there are more than 500 words in this 8,000+ word essay that is actually just 8,001 words, but I’m not sure since I didn’t count every single one or check the convenient feature in the word program I am using that counts how many words there are in this 8,000+ word essay that is actually just 8,001 words.
